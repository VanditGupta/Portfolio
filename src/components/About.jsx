        Hello there! I'm a dedicated Data Scientist deeply engaged with Cloud
        and Big Data tech, particularly Microsoft Azure. My journey includes
        leading teams and enhancing data management and analytics for Fortune
        500 clients in education and public sectors as a Digital Specialist
        Engineer at Infosys. Currently expanding my horizons with a Master of
        Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University, I've dived into
        Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Computer Vision. My research has
        led to four publications, focusing on text classification, predictive
        analytics, and accident detection. I'm all about solving real-world
        problems with image processing and computer vision, driven by a blend of
        innovation and efficiency. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate
        and revolutionize the digital landscape together!
